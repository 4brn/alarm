## 1. Introduction

Security is a fundamental concern in shared living spaces, particularly in student accommodations where multiple residents need to feel safe sharing their living space with others. Traditional alarm systems can be expensive and complex to install, and may pose a risk to the privacy of other students making them impractical for temporary housing situations. This project addresses the need for an affordable, flexible security solution tailored to the unique requirements of student housing and shared spaces.

### 1.1 Project Overview

The project is a proof-of-concept alarm system designed specifically for student accommodation and shared living environments. The system consists of:

1. **Hardware Component**

   > ESP32 microcontroller equipped with a motion sensor and alarm buzzer. All sensors used are part of a development kit.

2. **Security Functionality**

   > Motion detection system that triggers an audible alarm when unauthorized movement is detected, providing a basic but effective security layer for shared spaces.

### 1.2 Topics Covered

- Intelligent Technologies
- Software Engineering

## 2. Topics

### 2.1 Intelligent Technologies

- Hardware-Software Interfacing
- Resource-Constrained Computing
- Microcontroller Programming
- Sensor Integration
- Real-time Event Processing

The project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller platform, which combines processing capabilities with wireless connectivity options. The system must continuously monitor sensor inputs and respond in real-time to detected motion events. This demonstrates fundamental concepts and embedded system design principles relevant to smart home and security applications.

The alarm system operates as an autonomous embedded application, processing sensor data and triggering appropriate responses without external intervention. The motion detection logic must be implemented efficiently to run continuously on the ESP32's limited resources. This mirrors the resource-efficient programming practices essential in embedded systems and IoT devices, where power consumption and processing capabilities are constrained.

### 2.2 Software Engineering

- Embedded Software Development
- Modular System Design
- Iterative Prototyping

The project follows established software engineering practices including version control (git) and modular code organization. The project emphasizes iterative development and testing methodologies. The modular architecture allows for future expansion, such as adding wireless notifications or integration with mobile applications.

## 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, this alarm system project provides a valuable hands-on learning experience that bridges hardware and software development. By addressing a practical need in student accommodation security, the project covers essential topics in embedded systems, IoT, and software engineering while remaining appropriately scoped. Project allows for iterative development and future enhancements as technical skills progress.
