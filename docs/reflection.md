## 1. Introduction

> This document shares what I learned and experienced while building the alarm system project.

## 2. Learning Outcomes

### 2.1 Orientation

I picked this project because it matched my interest in embedded systems.

### 2.2 Creating Professional IT Products

#### 2.2.1 Analysis & Advice

I looked at existing alarm systems and saw that students need a simple, cheap way to protect their stuff in dorm rooms. Due to my lack of knowledge of embedded systems I decided to use a development kit that provided a number of sensors and documentation about how to use them. Out of all of the sensors only 4 components suited my project idea so I didn't use the other ones.

#### 2.2.2 Design

I planned out how the alarm would work before building it. The design focused on a simple state machine that switches between armed and disarmed modes, with clear feedback for the user.

#### 2.2.3 Realisation

I built the alarm following my design plan. I wired up the motion sensor, programmed the microcontroller, and made sure the siren worked properly. The focus was on keeping everything small and easy to use.

#### 2.2.4 Validation

I tested the alarm in different situations to make sure it worked correctly. I checked that it detected motion properly and that the siren was loud enough to be useful.

### 2.3 Professional Standards & Personal Leadership

#### 2.3.2 FeedPulse

Although I did not search for a lot of feedback from the teachers (time was spent mostly learning about microcontrollers), I still kept them informed on my progress. I asked my classmates and teachers for feedback often. 

## 3. Future Steps

- Get better at planning my time.
- Ask for feedback more often from different people.
- Work on bigger projects to learn more about embedded systems.

This reflection document shares my experiences and what I learned this semester while working on the alarm system project.
